 * const peers = new VOXELIZE.Peers<VOXELIZE.Character>();
 *
 * // Add the peers group to the world.
 * world.add(peers);
 *
 * // Define what a new peer looks like.
 * peers.createPeer = (id) => {

 * };
 *
 * // Define what happens when a peer data is received.
 * peers.onPeerUpdate = (peer, data) => {

 *
 * // In the render loop, update the peers manager.
 * peers.update();
