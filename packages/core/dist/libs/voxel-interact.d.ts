 * The VoxelInteract class is used to interact with voxels in the {@link World} instance. It consists of two main parts:
 *
 * - {@link VoxelInteract.potential}: The potential block placement. This is the data of a block's orientation that can be placed.
 * - {@link VoxelInteract.target}: The targeted block. This is the voxel that the camera is looking at.
 *
 * You can use these two properties to place blocks, remove blocks, and more.
 *
 * # Example
 * ```ts
 * // Create a new VoxelInteract instance.
 * const voxelInteract = new VoxelInteract(camera, world);
 *
 * // Add the voxel interact to the scene.
 * world.add(voxelInteract);
 *
 * // Set the target block to air.
 * if (voxelInteract.target) {
 *   const [vx, vy, vz] = voxelInteract.target;
 *   world.updateVoxel(vx, vy, vz, 0);
 * }
 *
 * // Update the interaction every frame.
 * voxelInteract.update();
