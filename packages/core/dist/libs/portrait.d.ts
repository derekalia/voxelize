/**
 * This class allows you to render a single THREE.js object to a canvas element.
 * This is useful for generating images of objects for use in the game. However, there
 * are performance bottlenecks that you should be aware of:
 * - The THREE.js renderer is shared between all instances of this class. This is because
 *   there is a limit to how many webgl contexts can be created.
 * - Each individual portrait has their own render loop. This means that if you have a lto
 *   of portraits, you will be rendering a lot of frames per second. This can be mitigated
 *   by either using the renderOnce parameter or utilizing the {@link ItemSlots} class, which
 *   batch renders objects in a grid-like fashion.
 *
 * # Example
 * ```ts
 * const portrait = new Portrait(world.makeBlockMesh(5));
 * document.body.appendChild(portrait.canvas);
 * ```
